Okay, last time I talked about the basic web page in Django, and it used
the shortest shortcut with the `render_to_reponse`, but there are manual
way to do the same thing using `Template` and `Context` class, and there are
many scenario where we might want to do it the manual way to have more
control, so to do it manually, here is the code:

    :::python
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.template import Context,Template
    from django.template.loader import get_template

    def index(request):
        """Here is how to do it manually"""
        # load the raw template string to the variable,
        # you can also manually define the string in the same file,
        # but that wouldn't be very maintainable, but it is basically
        # an ordinary string
        t = get_template('index.html')
        c = Context({'title':'The Index Page','text':'Hello World!'})
        html = t.render(c)
        # return the http request, and pass html as the
        # body of the response
        return HttpResponse(html)
