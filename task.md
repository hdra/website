This is an astro site that renders my personal website. Help me design it. I am a software engineer, and I     │
│   want to have a section for a blog posts that might include code snippets and other technical contents. I also  │
│   have photography as a hobby, and I want to have a place to post pictures as a gallery or a photo essays.       │
│   There should also be some section where I can post things like projects and experiments highlights.            │
│                                                                                                                  │
│   Help me design and create the structure for this website. Design should be minimalist, serif, timeless.
